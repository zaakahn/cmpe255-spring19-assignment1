It was small and didnt have a ton of variety at the time I arrived, but it looks from the pictures like they usually have a lot more than what I saw. Still, my donuts were pretty tasty, namely the maple bacon.   I remember seeing the German chocolate donut and saying Oh, thats too much for me. Then when I ordered, I asked for a coconut donut (different from the German chocolate). Come to find out after I left, she gave me a German chocolate one, not the coconut one. And thats the one I was most excited to have.   The lady helping me was really nice, even though she botched my order.

      "10  \"This is definitely not a 4-star worthy buffet. Before I went here for dinner, my understanding was that even though its an older buffet (when you compare it to Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal Buffet, etc), but the food is still very good. That is completely not true, not only its an old buffet, the food is no where near the standards of some the new buffets at all.  We went on a Monday evening at about 5 PM, there was a 90 minute wait. By now, I am used to waiting for buffets, so it was not a big deal. Dinner was $32.99 on weekday nights as of August of 2013, it is on par with the other nicer buffets on the strip. Food offered in very limited variety, the Asian station was a joke. Ive seen much better food at some of the cheaper buffets. Overall, unless you are staying at the hotel and want a quick bite when there is no line, I dont see any reason why anyone would come here. I will certainly not come back. If you are looking for a nice buffet, I would go to Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal or the Wynn. If you are looking for a more budget conscious buffet, I would recommend going to the Palm.\"\\n   \n",

      "37  \"I went to La Cochonne rit on a week day lunch. There was people but it wasnt packed so it was quick and nice. I ordered the duck club sandwich, I though: duck in a club, this should be the new standard. It was good but a bit blend however. My boyfriend took the tacos which were also nice. The service was effective and cheerful but the food was ordinary. Maybe its better for diner.\"\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
      "43  \"Finally made it to the Original Pancake House, never been, but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes. I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me  1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe its a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa  2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50s cool diner, this wasnt an new place   3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game   4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how its like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.  5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so Im guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young haha  Also, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and its not that I was in a rush I just wasnt into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it?   After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha thats what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasnt enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I dont like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me.   Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, Im not sure Ill be back.\"\\n   \n",
